This means words in the English language that are very common but do not contribute much to the meaning of the documents will likely have near-zero TF-IDF scores.

    "### Naive Bayes for Sentiment Classification\n",
    "Naive bayes is a very simple classification algorithm with fast training times and generally good performance for text classification tasks. It involves applying Bayes' Theorem with the \"naive\" assumption that all of the features are independent from each other. Naive bayes is based on the concept of conditional probability. Given an instance of $n$ features $x = (x_1, ... x_n)$ and a set of $k$ classes $C = (C_1, ..., C_k)$, this algorithm assigns conditional probabilities in the following form for each of the $k$ classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "p(C_k \\space| \\space (x_1, ..., x_n))\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression above basically represents the probability of the class $C_k$ given the features in $x$. In the context of our sentiment analysis problem, there are two classes (1 and 0) where one represents a positive review and the other represents a negative review. The feature vector $x$ for this problem is basically the TF-IDF vector with the scores for each word in the corpus for a particular review. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem, with reference to this conditional probability is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "p(C_k \\space| \\space x) = \\frac{p(C_k)p(x \\space | \\space C_k)}{p(x)}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, this theorem, in the context of our problem, states that the probability of a review being belonging to a specific class $C_k$ (ie. positive or negative) is equal to the probability of the class $C_k$ multiplied by the probability of the TF-IDF vector $x$ given that it belongs to the class $C_k$ divided by the probability of the TF-IDF vector $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can expand the conditional probability of the TF-IDF vector as a product of each of the conditional probabilities of each of its components with respect to the class $C_k$. Let's assume that the vector $x$ has the components $x_1$, $x_2$, ... $x_n$. Then our equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "p(C_k \\space | \\space x) = \\frac{p(C_k)p(x_1 \\space | \\space C_k)p(x_2 \\space | \\space C_k)...p(x_n \\space| \\space C_k)}{p(x_1)p(x_2)...p(x_n)}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can expand $p(x)$ and $p(x \\space | \\space C_k)$ as products because naive bayes is based on the \"naive\" assumption that **each of our features are independent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these equations and a TF-IDF vector for a given review, the naive bayes algorithm involves calculating the conditional probability of each possible class given the features in the vector and then selecting the **class with the highest conditional probability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating the probability of each feature\n",
    "One question that remains in our discussion of this algorithm is how can we can actually calculate the probability of each feature in the TF-IDF vector? There are a few different versions of naive bayes that use different probability distributions to calculate the probability of each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gaussian Naive Bayes - The Normal/Gaussian Distribution\n",
    "Gaussian naive bayes assumes that each feature belongs to a **normal** or **gaussian** distribution. The behavior of the normal distribution is determined by two parameters, the **mean** and the **standard deviation**. A standard normal distribution has a **mean of 0** and a **standard deviation of 1**. The standard normal distribution can be graphed using the following equation (the PDF or probability density function of the distribution):\n",

    "### Using K-Fold Cross Validation\n",
    "Cross validation is a technique for evaluating model performance that is similar to what we have been doing so far. A common form of cross validation, known as **k-fold cross validation**, involves splitting a dataset into a single multiple sections called **folds** (k folds to be exact!) and in a single iteration, using **k-1 folds for training** and just **one fold for testing**. This process is then repeated **k times** with a different fold being used as test data each time. The values of the evaluation metrics for each **iteration** can then be averaged to get a more robust measure of a model's performance. This practice is better than using the same test set again and again because optimizing a model's performance on one specific test set in effect makes that test set a part of the training set. \n",

    "### Logistic Regression for Sentiment Classification\n",
    "Unlike what the name suggest, **logistic regression** is designed specifically for **classification** and is especially suited for **binary classification** problems. The real **\"regression\"** in logistic regression involves finding the best values in a weight vector that is used to compute a weighted sum of the input features. This weighted sum is then passed to a function called the **sigmoid function** also known as the **logistic function**. This function has a special property where it takes any real-valued input and outputs a continuous value between 0 and 1. In general, if the output of this function is below 0.5 we can assign the input to class 0 and if the output is greater than or equal to 0.5, we can assign the input to class 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Logistic Regression Works\n",
    "The **logistic function** is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\phi (z) = \\frac {1} {1+e^{-z}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "To better illustrate the concept of the **logistic function**, the function has been plotted below in the interval [-10, 10]. Notice how the function forms an S-shaped curve with horizonal asymptotes at y = 0 and y = 1. What's special about this function is that it can take any real value and output a value between 0 and 1, which is really useful for representing probabilities."

    "#### Where this function comes from - log odds (logit)\n",
    "This function comes from the concept of the odds ratio in probability, which for a probability p, of a given event, is defined as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "odds(p) = \\frac {p} {(1-p)}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you hear someone say the odds of an event are 1:1, then that means there is a 50% chance of that event happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "By taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides, we can define the **logit** or **log odds** function. \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "logit(p) = ln \\frac {p} {(1-p)}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The **logistic function** which we defined earlier is actually the **inverse** of the **logit** function. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying the Logistic Function to a Weighted Sum of Features\n",
    "The logistic regression model is based on the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "logit \\ (p(y=1 \\ | \\ x)) = w_0 x_0 + w_1 x_1 + ... + w_m x_m = \\sum_{i=0}^n w_m x_m = w^T x\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ x = (x_0, x_1, ..., x_n) $ represents the input in the form of a vector of features given to the model.\n",
    "- $ p(y=1 \\ | \\ x) $ is the conditional probability that given an input $ x $, the data point belongs to the class $ y = 1 $. For our case, this is probability that given the values of variables like Gender, Age, Class, etc. that a person survived the Titanic.\n",
    "- $ w = (w_0, w_1, ..., w_n) $ represents a vector of numerical weights that will be used to compute the weighted sum of the inputs.\n",
    "- $ w^T x $ is just a short way to write the weighted sum of the features using matrix notation. Since x and w are actually just one dimensional matrices (vectors), this is basically equivalent to taking the dot product of x and w (multiply each feature by each corresponding weight and add them up!).\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying the **logistic function** to **both sides** of the equation above we get the following result:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "p(y=1 \\ | \\ x) = \\phi(w^T x)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "This basically means that the output that comes from applying this function to a weighted sum of the features gives us the probability that an observation belongs to the class 1. In our case, the raw output from the model when making a prediction will give us the probability that a person survived the titanic. Hence, if this probability is **greater than our equal to 0.5** (**50% or more chance** they survived) then our model predicts that the person survived. Otherwise, the model predicts that the person did not survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to logistic regression generates class predictions\n",
    "The class predictions that come out of a logistic regression model are based on the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y =\n",
    "  \\begin{cases}\n",

    "#### How the model learns the weights\n",
    "The process of \"learning\" in logistic regression involves determining the **optimal weights** in the weight vector to **minimize** a cost function defined below for a weight vector $w$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "Cost(w) = \\sum_{i=0}^n \\frac {1} {2} (\\hat y_i - y_i)^2 + \\frac {\\lambda} {2} \\sum_{j=1}^m |w_{j}^2|\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the first part of this function is essentially half the sum of squared errors between the predicted values (classes) denoted as $\\hat y_i$ for the ith observation in the data and the actual values, denoted as $y_i$ for the ith observation in the data. For a given weight vector $w$ and an input $x_i$ we know that $\\hat y_i = \\phi(w^T x_i)$ based on the equation for the logistic regression algorithm. The second half of the equation, $ \\frac {\\lambda} {2} \\sum_{j=1}^m w_{j}^2 $ is known as the regularization term and is used to control the values of weights by adding a constant times the square of the magnitude of the weight vector to the cost function.\n",

    "#### Why do we call it a cost function? What is the purpose of a cost function?\n",
    "The cost function is used to quantify how bad our classifier is doing at making predictions on training data. Cost functions are sometimes called **loss functions** but the idea is the same - both tell us how bad our classifier is doing and in general, we want to **minimize** the values of these functions, which is like minimizing a cost or loss. In algorithms that involve learning numerical weights, cost functions give our algorithms a metric for which to learn the optimal weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do we actually minimize the cost function\n",
    "The process of minimizing the cost function involves an optimization process known as **gradient descent**. The idea behind gradient descent is that we can exploit the fact that our cost function is quadratic by looking at the direction in which our cost function is changing with respect to the weights (basically a derivative) and update our weights in a manner that causes our cost function to continue decreasing until we reach the global minimum, or the vertex of our quadratic curve. The mathematical details of this optimization method are out of the scope of this workshop, but are commonly used in deep learning and if you are interested, you can read more here: http://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gradient_descent.html\n",

    "\n",
    "#### What is regularization? \n",
    "Regularization is a common practice in machine learning used to control **overfitting** - the situation in which a model becomes too constrained to the patterns in the training data and fails to generalize to unseen data. Regularization works by adding a term that involves the magnitude of the weight vector to the cost function. Doing so penalizes larger weights and prevents any one feature from receiving too much weight in the model. There are two common types of regularization used for logistic regression and those are L2 and L1 regularization. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **L2 Regularization**: This form of regularization is the same as regularization used in the original cost function above and involves the regularization term $ \\frac {\\lambda} {2} \\sum_{j=1}^m w_{j}^2 $.\n",
    "- **L1 Regularization**: This form of regularization involves a different regularization term $ \\frac {\\lambda} {2} \\sum_{j=1}^m |w_{j}| $. The difference here is that we are summing the absolute values of each weight and multipyling by a constant. L1 regularization tends to produce weight vectors where less important features have weights that are close to, if not exactly zero. For this reason, this type of regularization is often good for feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant related to logistic regression that we use to optimize the amount of regularization is referred to as $ C $ and is related to the regularization parameter $ \\lambda $ by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "C = \\frac {1} {\\lambda}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "When training a logistic regression model in SciKit-Learn we can pass in values for C and specify the type of regularization that we want to use."
